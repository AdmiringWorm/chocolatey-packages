    <description><![CDATA[Would you like to move beyond hand-drawn plasmid maps?

SnapGene Viewer is revolutionary software that allows molecular biologists to create, browse, and share richly annotated DNA sequence files up to 1 Gb in length.

### Visualize
- Create a DNA sequence file by either entering a sequence, or importing a record from GenBank, or opening an annotated sequence stored in one of many common [file formats][].
- Browse or print a DNA sequence and its annotations using customizable Map, Sequence, Enzymes, Features, Primers, and History views.
- Search a DNA sequence to match either a DNA query, or a protein translation, or an annotation.
- View and edit DNA sequence traces.

![Trace Viewer][]

### Annotate
- Automatically annotate common features, or manually annotate coding sequences and other features.
- Design and annotate primers for PCR, sequencing, or mutagenesis.
- Identify open reading frames (ORFs) with a single mouse click.

### Share
- Export a plasmid map as an image, or export an annotated DNA sequence to GenBank format.
- Freely share data with your colleagues or customers using the universally accessible SnapGene format.
