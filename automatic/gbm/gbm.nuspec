    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

Visit http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/index.html for news and updates regarding new releases.

***New in 1.1.8***

All Platforms:

- Added the ability to backup and restore saved games that are stored in the Windows registry:
	- This feature is also supported in Linux for Windows games running in Wine/Proton.
	- Please see the [online manual](http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#registry) for more details on how to use this feature.
- On startup, GBM now waits up to one minute for the current backup location to become available before displaying an error message.
	- The error message can now be canceled to continue waiting.
	- This is useful for delayed network shares on startup or if you forgot to plug in an external backup drive.
- The "Choose Game" window now displays tags in addition to the game name when multiple configurations are detected.
- The "Backup Confirmation" window should now always get top focus after a gaming session ends.
	- This fix has also been applied to other important messages to make sure they don't get hidden behind other windows.
- The Game Manager and Custom Variable Manager now use a different folder browser where applicable.	
	- The new browser provides better usability for power users, other areas of the app will still use the classic folder browser.
	- The new browser allows Linux users to "Show Hidden Folders", which can't be done using the classic Folder Browser.
- When a UNC path is used for the backup folder, the disk space check prior to backups will be automatically disabled because it cannot be done.
- The disk space check prior to backups can now be disabled in the "Backup and Restore" settings.	
- Added "Operating System" field to game configurations:
	- "Windows" and "Linux" are the only valid choices at this time and only Linux users are allowed to change this field.
- Changed how GBM initilizes on startup to fix some long standing issues.
- Fixed some inconsistencies with form icons and when forms are shown in the task bar.
- GBM no longer provides a warning about "Syncing Game IDs" when importing configurations in the Game Manager.
	- The warning was very confusing and is no longer relevant to most users.
	- The "Sync Game IDs" Tool will continue to be available for now, but the messaging has been changed warning not to use it without reading the manual first.

Windows:

- Updated SQLite to 3.27.2
- Updated 7-Zip to 19.00

Linux:

- You can now set GBM to automatically start on log-in via the "Startup" settings.
	- This requires that GBM be installed via a package manager or the makefile, so any required files are in a known location.  The option will be disabled otherwise.
- The "Start Minimized" option is now available in "Startup" settings.
- GBM now stores all Wine configuration data seperately from the core game configuration:
	- The core configuration is no longer altered in any way when a game is detected running in Wine or Proton.
	- The Wine configuration data is now automatically updated each time a game is detected, such as when running the game from a new prefix.
	- This data can be viewed and manually modified on the Game Manager.
- Fixed the handling of Wine/Proton games when multiple configurations are detected.
- Fixed a crash when using "Backup Only" and "New Backups Pending" filters on the Game Manager.
- The Mono and GBM process will now exit cleanly if a critical error occurs during startup.
- GBM will no longer show the exit dialog when a critical error occurs.
