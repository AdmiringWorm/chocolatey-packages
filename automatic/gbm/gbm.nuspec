    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.2.5***

All Platforms:

- Overhauled the user interface.
	- The "Start-Up Wizard" and "Add Game Wizard" instructions are now easier to read with a larger font.
	- Most buttons in the application are now larger with icons (Thanks to @Darthagnon for help with icons).
	- The redundant "Close" button has been removed from many forms.
	- The "Main Window" now has a collapsible game list with a search filter and quick access to features such backup, restore and game launching.
		- These new features can be disabled or hidden by default in Settings -&gt; User Interface.
	- The "Game Manager" has been slimmed down for ease of use.
		- The size of the form has been reduced and the sections have been split into tabs.
		- Certain buttons and checkboxes have been moved into sub-menus.
	- The "Settings" form has been reorganized into more sections.
	- The "Quick Launch" feature introduced in v1.2.4 has been removed since games can now be launched directly from the main window.
- Added the option to detect games using a window title instead of a process name.
	- This adds another option for detecting games that all run from the same executable. Such as emulated games, browser games, or cloud service games.
	- In addition to the process ending, GBM will also end monitoring when the window title no longer matches the game configuration.
	- This feature is not supported in Linux, see the "Known Issues" section for details.
- Added option to show a notification when a backup operation has been completed.
	- This option is available in the "Backup and Restore" section of the Settings window, it defaults to disabled.
	- A single notification will be shown when a backup operation is completed, even if the operation included multiple games.
- Added "Detection Speed" setting.
	- Allows users monitoring for hundreds or even thousands of games at once to greatly lower CPU usage at the cost of detection speed.
	- The average user with a normal sized game list should never need to adjust this setting, even the "Fast" setting will use very little CPU power every few seconds.
	- This option is available in the "General" section of the Settings window, it defaults to "Fast".
- The "Icon" field now supports the use of Environment and Custom Path variables.
- The "Search" filter on the Main Window and Game Manager now supports filtering by tag.
	- Tags must be an exact match.
- AbsolutePath is now a calculated field and no longer stored.
	- This will break official lists for prior versions of GBM (v1.1.5 - v1.2.4).  The last official list(s) compatible with these versions will be archived so they can still be accessed.
- Application settings are now handled more efficiently.
- Added missing code to properly update or delete existing launch data when certain configuration changes are made.
- Fixed issues with changing the Game ID when that configuration had existing backup files.

Windows:

- The icons from game executables are now cached after a session.
	- The "Main Window" and "Game Manager" will display the cached icon when viewing the game details, unless a custom icon has been set.
	- Cached icons are stored using the PNG format in the GBM temporary folder (can be customized in Settings).
	
Known Issues (Linux):

- Detecting games by window title does not work.
	- Mono hasn't implemented the "MainWindowTitle" property in System.Diagnostics.Process, so this feature is not supported in Linux at this time.
