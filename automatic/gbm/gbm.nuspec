    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

This is a little larger than the usual maintenance release...it contains some new features for all the save scummers out there. :godmode: Enjoy.

***New in 1.3.6***

All Platforms:

- Added the ability to backup and restore saved games for the currently monitored game by using the "Backup" and "Restore" buttons on the main window.
	- This allows you to save scum while a game is running, without interrupting the current session.
	- Read the [Backup and Restore during Gameplay](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#livebackup) section of the manual for more details and recommendations when using this feature.	
	- This feature is disabled by default.  Enable it in [Settings -&gt; Backup and Restore](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#settings_backupandrestore).	
- Fixed issues that could cause the Ludusavi Manifest import to fail.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when cancelling detection and re-enabling while using the "Fast" detection speed.
- Changed how concurrent operations are handled.
	- A backup, restore or import operation cannot be queued while another is currently in progress, a warning notification is now displayed if this occurs.
	- Syncs triggered by another application and automatic backup restores can now execute while GBM is currently monitoring a session or paused while working in another window such as the Game Manager.
		- Automatic backup restores may still fail if they happen to queue during another operation in progress.
- The "Esc" key can now be used to shutdown the app or hide the main window to the system tray, depending on the "User Interface" settings.
- Updated YamlDotNet to 13.1.1.

Windows:

- Added the ability to backup or restore saved games for the last played, selected or currently monitored game by using global hotkeys.
	- This allows you to quickly backup or restore your save(s) without the need to switch to GBM. 
	- This feature is disabled by default, it can be configured in [Settings -&gt; Global Hotkeys](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#settings_globalhotkeys) and [Settings -&gt; Backup and Restore](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#settings_backupandrestore).  
	- This feature is not available in Linux.
- Added unique "Success" or "Failure" audio that will play when a backup or restore is triggered from a hotkey.
- Updated SQLite3 to 3.42.0.
- Updated 7-Zip to 23.01.

Linux:

- The main window can now be hidden to the system tray when closed.
	- Uncheck "Exit when closing window" in "Main Window Options" of [Settings -&gt; User Interface](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#settings_ui) to enable this feature.
	- It can also be hidden automatically on startup by checking the "Start minimized" option in [Settings -&gt; Startup](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#settings_startup).
- GBM no longer needs to wait 60 seconds before automatically restoring new backups (if enabled) when the app starts.

Known Issues (Linux):

- The main window may not redraw correctly if resized after it's been restored from the system tray.
