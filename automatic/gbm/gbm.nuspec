    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.4.3***

🎄🎁   

General:

- Added Japanese language support.
	- Thank you @nihongo-helper0119 for providing the Japanese translation.
- Added the ability to manually set the user interface language.
	- GBM will use your operating system language by default.
	- The Settings -&gt; User Interface panel now allows you to choose from any of the available languages. 
- Added the ability to run GBM in a fully portable mode.
	- In portable mode, GBM will store all user and temporary data in the same location as the app instead of using the user's OS profile folder.
	- You must have write permissions to the application folder for GBM to start in portable mode.
	- GBM does not automatically move any of your existing data when switching between normal mode and portable mode.
	- To enable portable mode:
		- Run the "Toggle Portable Mode" script in the application folder, then start GBM.
			- "Toggle Portable Mode.bat" is for Windows and "Toggle Portable Mode.sh" is for Linux.
		- You can also manually create an empty file named "portable.ini" (case-sensitive depending on the OS) in the application folder to enable portable mode.				
			- Delete the "portable.ini" file to return to normal mode.
	- A new indicator on the main window status bar shows which mode you are currently in.
	- The installer packages aren't meant for use with portable mode and do not include the toggle scripts.	
- Changed how GBM starts linked processes.
	- You can now set a start-up delay for each linkable process in the Process Manager.
	- Processes are now started on a seperate thread.
- Updated the Start-Up Wizard.
	- You can now choose the UI language on the first step.
	- The application folder is suggested as a default backup location if running in portable mode.
- Fixed some long standing issues with GBM's initialization sequence.
- Changed the size of some controls and forms to better support multiple languages.	
- Updated Components
	- YamlDotNet 16.1.3 -&gt; 16.3.0
	- SQLite 3.50.2 -&gt; 3.50.4 (Windows)
	- 7-Zip 25.00 -&gt; 25.01 (Windows)

Known Issues:

- GBM may not properly display characters for a language that does not match the current desktop language while running in Mono (Linux).  To resolve this issue:
	- Set the LANG environment variable to the language you wish to use before running GBM.  Ex. LANG=ja_JP.utf-8
	- Ensure you have a language/font package installed for the language you wish to use.
	- Set your desktop language to the language you wish to use in GBM.
	- Consult the documentation for your desktop/linux distribution for more help.
- Some buttons and/or other controls still appear in English while GBM is set to another language.  To resolve this issue:
	- Set your operating system/desktop language to the language you wish to use in GBM.
