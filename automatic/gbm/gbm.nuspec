    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.3.1***

All Platforms:

- Support for importing configurations from the primary [Ludusavi Manifest](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest) or any file using the manifest structure.
	- [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi) is another open source saved game backup tool.
	- The primary [Ludusavi Manifest](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest) contains thousands of backup configurations sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com).
	- See the [Ludusavi Manifest](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#ludusavi) section of the manual for more information about this feature.
- Support for games that use Steam Cloud save locations.
	- The official game lists may now contain configurations that use Steam Cloud locations with valid path variables.
	- Configurations using Steam Cloud locations will not be displayed for import unless the required path variables exist.
	- GBM can auto-configure the path variables required for Steam Cloud locations if possible.
		- This feature must be enabled manually in Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Optional Features -&gt; "Enable automatic configuration of store paths"
	- See the [Store Variables](https://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#storevariables) section of the manual for more information about this feature.		
- Improvements to the Import window.	
	- Configurations with detected saved games are selected and displayed by default when importing from official lists.
	- The "Select All" checkbox should now function in a more expected manner.
	- Column sizes will no longer reset when filters are applied.
	- Columns now automatically resize when the form is resized.
	- Added columns to display more information about each configuration.
	- Fixed performance issues when filtering or sorting large data sets.
	- Improved saved game detection.
		- Windows registry configurations are now detected.
		- Better detection of configurations that use file includes.
	- Improved method of loading and displaying configurations.
		- This will provide a better user experience when loading and handling lists with thousands of configurations.
		- Due to the performance improvements, the "Selected" counter was no longer feasible and had to be removed.
	- Removed the initial confirmation when importing from official lists.
- The GameID will now automatically be used for the backup sub-folder and file name of any configuration using duplicate names, regardless of the global setting for folder &amp; file names.
	- This is done as a safety measure to prevent unknowingly overwriting the backup file of another configuration using the same name.
	- Edit any duplicate configuration names and make them unique to prevent this from happening.
- Fixed a long-standing issue with backup manifest data not loading for some configurations sharing the same name.
- Fixed an issue with the import feature not syncing immediately after being used from the main window or system tray.
- Fixed an issue with configuration paths not being updated correctly when changing a custom path variable name and path at the same time.
- Fixed an issue with the Include/Exclude builder in the Game Manager not opening to the correct folder when using a custom path variable in the "Game Path" and a relative "Save Path".
- Improved the pending backup notification feature.	
	- Clicking notification now opens the Game Manager to the "Backup Management" tab with the first game selected.
	- The notification will no longer keep reappearing during a session when all pending backups are not restored.
- Improved method of checking for updates and caching files imported from the web.
- Moved "Log Options" to the "User Interface" section of the Settings window.

Linux:

- Fixed games running in Wine not being detected.
	- "wine-preloader, wine, wine64-preloader, wine64" will now be detected instead of just the preloader variants.
