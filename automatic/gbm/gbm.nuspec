    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features
- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes
- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.1.5***

All Platforms:

- Fixed a crash that could occur when renaming a game configuration.
- Rewrote portions of game detection:
	- The handling of duplicate game configurations has been flawed since regular expression support was added in v1.1.  This has been fixed.
	- GBM is now more efficient when detecting games by parameter and/or process path.
- Changed how save path variables are handled:
	- GBM no longer uses it's own format and naming scheme for path variables.    
	- GBM now uses Windows environment variables in game configurations.  
		- For example, `*appdatalocal*` is now `%LOCALAPPDATA%` in a Windows configuration.
		- GBM also uses some custom environment variables, such as `%USERDOCUMENTS%` and `%COMMONDOCUMENTS%`.  These are needed for compatability and to handle some limitations with how GBM interacts with 7-Zip.
	- GBM now uses the XDG specification for game configurations in Linux. (Thanks basxto!)
		- For example, `*appdatalocal*` is now `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}` in a Linux configuration.
	- Custom Path Variables have changed.  For example, `*Steam User Data*` will now be `%Steam User Data%`.
		- They will appear this way in Windows and Linux.
		- GBM will no longer allows the creation of variables using reserved names, such as APPDATA.
	- Your configurations will be automatically updated to these new formats when upgrading to v1.1.5.
	- **These changes will break game list compatability with other versions of GBM.  Archived lists are available at http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html for those that wish to stay on an older version.**
- Added a new setting, "Show resolved save paths in Game Manager".
	- This new setting is enabled by default.
	- When enabled, GBM will display resolved save paths in the Game Manager.  This is how GBM displayed paths prior to v1.1.5.
	- When disabled, GBM will display save paths with their variables when applicable.
- Added a tooltip to applicable "Path" fields on the Game Manager.
	- This tooltip either displays either a resolved or unresolved path.  
	- The behaviour is toggled by the "Show resolved save paths" setting.
- Added "Import Backup Files" feature to the Game Manager.
	- This feature allows you to import one or more backup files for a specific game configuration.
	- This is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files.  It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.
	- GBM cannot verify that the backups being imported are compatible with the current configuration.  This is up to the user!
	- This feature will be expanded and refined in future releases.
	
Linux:

- Fixed an issue that prevented Wine / Proton games from being detected in some cases.
- GBM can now use any Windows configuration to detect and backup games running in Wine / Proton.
	- An absolute Windows save path, such "%APPDATA%\Game\Saved Games" will be automatically converted to the proper path within the detected Wine prefix.
	- The converted path will be saved to the configuration once game has been detected at least once.
	- You cannot restore a backup using an absolute Windows path.  The game needs to be detected at least once so the correct save path can be determined.
	- This feature should be considered "Beta" and may not work in all scenarios.  Please report any issues you may encounter!

Website:

- Search features have been added to the Official Game Lists (Thanks basxto!)
	- Includes advanced features such as searching by tag and excludes.
	- Tags are now clickable for automatic searching of similar games.
	- Searches are linkable.
	- You can now link directly to a single configuration using the new link icon.
	- Configurations intelligently collapse or uncollapse based on search results.
