    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.2.2***

All Platforms:

- Added new settings to customize the UI
	- Added "Exit when closing main window"
		- Allows the user to exit the app completely when closing the main window, instead of hiding it.
		- This option defaults to enabled in Linux and disabled in Windows.		
	- Added "Exit without confirmation"
		- Allows the user to exit the app without the confirmation pop-up.
		- This defaults to disabled in both Linux and Windows.
- Attempted to unify how the UI functions in Windows / Linux and reduce the amount of platform specific work-arounds.	
	- You can now minimize the main window to the taskbar in Windows.
	- You can no longer double-click the tray icon or use the "Show / Hide" option to toggle the visibility of the main window.		
		- The "Show / Hide" option has been replaced by "Restore Window".
		- Double-clicking the tray icon or using "Restore Window" will always restore the app to a normal, visible state and give it focus.		
	- Unfortunately, the main window cannot be hidden in Linux.  In cases where it's supposed to be hidden, it will be minimized instead.
		- Hiding the main window in Linux requires too many work-arounds and my goal was to reduce the amount of platform specific code.
- Improved platform detection.
	- The "About Game Backup Monitor" window will now display which platform the app is running on (Mono or .NET) and the version.
- Reduced the amount of platform specific code when the app initalizes, this may improve performance.
- The "Start-Up Wizard" will now always appear in the center of screen, instead of sometimes appearing in a random location.
- The system tray menu is now disabled during the "Start-Up Wizard".
- Updated window titles on the custom folder browsers to give more concise instructions.
- Fixed the forced import of multiple backup files when using the Game Manager.
	- It will now create manifest entries for each file when appropriate, instead of just the newest file.

Linux:

- Fixed the incorrect save path being stored in the metadata when making backups from games running in Proton / Wine.
- Moved the wine path detection output into a debug mode instead of cluttering up the log.
- The Include/Exclude builder on the Game Manager will now properly open to the Proton / Wine saved game path when possible.
