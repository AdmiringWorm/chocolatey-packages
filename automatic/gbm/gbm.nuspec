    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.2.6***

All Platforms:

- Any linked process that requires administrator privileges will now ask for elevation when being launched from GBM.
	- This means GBM no longer needs to be running as administrator to launch these linked processes.
- If GBM quits unexpectedly during a backup operation, such as a power outage or OS shutdown, any incomplete backup operations will be resumed automatically the next time you run the app.
- The "Play" button on the main form is now disabled for a few seconds after a game launch is triggered.
	- This prevents attempting to launch a game multiple times by accident.
- Fixed a crash that occurs on game detection when GBM cannot access the process details.
- Fixed the possibility of caching the incorrect icon in some situations.
- Prevented a confusing error from being shown in the log when an icon can't be cached for expected reasons.
- Fixed an issue that caused GBM to unnecessarily require the "Game Path" when detecting a game with a "Monitor Only" configuration.
- Fixed an issue with the automatic restore feature that could cause restore operations to trigger multiple times when using linked configurations.
- Fixed an issue that caused GBM to repeatedly detect the same process if an unexpected error occurred while waiting for that process to end.
	- The error message will now be displayed in the log and monitoring will be automatically stopped.
- The "Last Action" field on the main form now uses the regional setting for "Short Time" instead of being set to a specific format.
- Fixed the "Limit" field always displaying zero on the Game Manager.
- Fixed various small issues with the user interface.
