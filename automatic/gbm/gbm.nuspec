    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

    <releaseNotes>### [Package Changelog](https://github.com/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/automatic/gbm/Changelog.md)

### Software Release notes

This is the final release of v1.2.0.  There were no new bug reports for the pre-release over 3 weeks and my own testing didn't turn up anything new.

Happy Holidays!

***New in 1.2.0***

All Platforms:

- Added the ability to easily backup or restore the entire game list.
	- Use the "Run Full Backup" or "Run Full Restore" options in the File menu or Tray menu to easily backup or restore your entire game list.
	- Any confirmations or checks requiring user input are automatically handled when using these tools.  See the "Full Backup and Restore" section of the manual for details.
- Added the ability to "link" game configurations.
	- This allows any linked configuration(s) to automatically run a backup or restore each time their parent is triggered.  This can continue in a chain.
	- This feature allows for the proper configuration of rare games that stored their saved games in multiple unique locations.  It may also have other creative uses.
	- Please read "Link -&gt; Configuration" in the "Game Manager" section of the manual for details on exactly how this feature works.
- Metadata is now added to all backup files.
	- This is a small XML file that contains important information about the archive and the configuration used to make the backup.
	- This allows GBM and possibly any other software to easily identify and use GBM backup files.
	- This file is not extracted when restoring a backup, it will not be cluttering up your saved game folders.
- All backup operations are now performed in a temporary folder before the resulting file is moved to the backup folder.
	- This change was required to fix periodic issues with cloud software (Dropbox) locking backup files while they were being created.
	- The temporary folder can be manually set in "Settings -&gt; Backup and Restore", it defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\gbm (~/.local/share/gbm).
- Improved the ability to import backup files using metadata.
	- There is a now a global tool to import backup files or entire folders available in the "Tools" menu.
	- Only backup files with GBM metadata can be imported using this new tool.
	- You may still force the import of any 7z archive using the "Import Backup Files" tool in the Game Manager.
- GBM now properly checks for available disk space when doing batch operations.
- GBM no longer attempts to search for a game when the process name is a regular expression, it isn't supported.
- Fixed various long-standing problems with the "Cancel" button.
	- Using "Cancel" during a backup or restore now properly cancels out of batch operations.
	- Using the "Cancel" button no longer prevents future operations from executing properly.
- The Help menu is no longer disabled unnecessarily when the application is busy.
- Various other small improvements have been made to the GUI and messages to improve usability.

***Changes from 1.2.0 Pre-Release 1***

All Platforms:

- Fixed various issues when linking to or from "Monitor Only" configurations.
