    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features
- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes
- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.1.6***

All Platforms:

- Added support for games that save to the Windows %PROGRAMDATA% location.
- The Game Manager now automatically selects the last detected game when opened.
- Backup files can no longer be imported into a "Monitor Only" configuration.
- Optimized the memory and cpu usage of Regular Expressions when monitoring for games.
- Added a "Recurse sub-folders" option
	- This option is set per game configuration, it is available on Include/Exclude window of the Game Manager and Add Game Wizard.
	- It is enabled by default on all current and new configurations.
	- Disabling this option prevents 7-Zip and GBM from scanning every sub-folder and file of a save path.  This useful when backing up specific files inside an extremely large folder.
- Fixed a possible issue with backups when the configuration uses folder path includes.
	
Linux:

- Fixed a memory leak issue with Mono and Regular Expressions.
- Fixed some issues when detecting the prefix of Wine/Proton games.
	- The default prefix (~/.wine) will be assumed when a detected game does not have the WINEPREFIX variable set.
	- A prefix can now be fully detected when it contains spaces.
- Windows configurations that use a relative save path are now properly converted when detected in Wine/Proton.
