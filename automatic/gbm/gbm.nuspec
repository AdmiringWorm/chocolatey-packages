    <description><![CDATA[Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.

Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!

Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.

## Features

- Backup your saves automatically and immediately after playing a game. No scheduling or input required!
- Backup to a cloud folder and add cloud save support to any game.
- GBM can detect and backup saves from games running on emulators or interpreters such as DOSBox, ScummVM or Wine.
- A growing list of pre-configured games for Windows and Linux.
- Easily setup an unlimited number of games to monitor, each with their own specific settings.
- Game configurations are designed to be easily portable and shared.
- GBM can automatically launch other software when a monitored game is detected, such as overlays or custom control schemes.
- Track the hours that you've played any monitored game, similar to Steam. (Optional)
- Track individual gaming sessions, know exactly when and how much you've played any monitored game. (Optional)

## Notes

- Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.

### Software Release notes

***New in 1.3.2***

All Platforms:

- Fixed an issue that could cause imports from the web to stop functioning after a failed download.
- Fixed an issue that caused recent changes to be lost if GBM was unexpectedly closed while working in certain windows, like the Game Manager.
- Fixed a crash that occurred when the "Configuration Links" window is opened on the Game Manager while adding a new configuration.
- Fixed various issues when importing backup files:
	- Backup files created by v1.2.8 can now be imported without errors.
	- Fixed the broken 7z file filter when importing backup files.	
	- Fixed an issue that could cause ManifestID constraint errors.
	- Fixed an issue that could cause differential backup imports to always fail.
- Changes to folder and file naming:
	- Removed the "Use Game ID for folder and file names" option from Settings.
	- Configurations using duplicate names will now use a more descriptive name format:
		- Game Name [Game ID] Ex. Metro Exodus [8ac11c11-8d18-471b-8f0d-aa154dc77f0e]	
	- The length of folder and file names is now more strict to minimize issues with the Windows max path limitation.
		- Only the first 64 characters of a game name will be used when creating folder and file names.
	- Modifying the name of a configuration will no longer automatically rename existing backup folders and files.
	- The above changes are only applied when creating new backup files.
	- I understand the recent naming changes may be frustrating to some users.  Please leave any feedback in the GitHub issues or discussions section.
- Improvements to the Game Manager:
	- Added a "Copy" feature.
		- This will make a copy of the currently selected game configuration(s).
		- The Core Configuration, Game Information, Tags, Processes and Configuration Links are included in the copy.
	- Added buttons to quickly open the current "Game Path" or "Save Path".
	- Some game configuration options have been renamed for clarification.
		- The "Monitor this game" option has been renamed to "Allow monitoring".
		- The "Monitor only" option has been renamed to "No backup when game ends".
	- The "Backup limit" and "Full backup interval" fields will no longer reset to 0 in the Game Manager if toggled off during an edit.
- Improvements to Importing Game Configurations:
	- The list will now try to retain the last scroll position after being refreshed.
	- You can now "Ignore" (or "Unignore") any configurations on the import window using the right-click menu.
		- This allows you to hide any configuration(s) that you never want to add or update during an import.
		- The ignored configurations are saved and persist between sessions.
		- You can show any hidden configurations by unticking the "Hide Ignored" checkbox.
	- Added new icons to indicate auto-detected and ignored configurations.
- General Interface improvements:
	- Added an "Open Backup Folder" option to the File menu (Main window and system tray).
	- You can now filter by "Tag" specifically in some search fields by using a hashtag in the search term. Ex. #Steam
		- In prior versions you didn't need to use a hashtag in the search term to filter by tag, but the results included both name and tag matches.
		- This feature is supported on the Main window, the Game Manager, and the Import window.		 		
	- All windows can now be closed and/or canceled out of edit mode by using the "Escape" key.
	- More windows will now ask for confirmation before closing if changes aren't yet saved.
	- Double-clicking a game in the main window list will now open it in the Game Manager.
	- You can now use the "Enter" key to confirm the "Ludusavi Options" window.	
- General performance improvements:
	- Some features that caused the interface to become unresponsive now run on a seperate thread.
	- Optimized various database queries.
