Friture is an application to visualize and analyze live audio data in real-time.
Friture displays audio data in several widgets, such as a scope, a spectrum analyzer, or a rolling 2D spectrogram.
This program can be useful to analyze and equalize the audio response of a hall, or for educational purposes, etc.
The name Friture is a french word for frying, also used for noise in a sound.

## Notes

- The installer causes quite a few positives for several anti-viruses, this seems to be caused by the usage of an unsigned installer.
- The uninstall is not completely silent, a dialog asking to remove Friture settings shows up
