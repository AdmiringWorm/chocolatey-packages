    <description><![CDATA[DnsControl is an [opinionated][] platform for seamlessly managing your DNS configuration across any number of DNS hosts, both in the cloud or in your own infrastructure. It manages all of the domains for the Stack Overflow network, and can do the same for your.

## Features
- Maintain your DNS data as high-level DS, with macros, and variables for easier updates.
- Eliminate vendor lock-in. Switch DNS providers easily, any time, with full fidelity.
- Supports 10+ DNS Providers including BIND, AWS Route 53, Google DNS, and name.com
- All the benefits of Git (or any VCS) for your DNS zone data. View history. Accept PRs.
- Runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, or any operating system supported by Go.
- Assign an IP address to a constant and use the variable name throughout the configuration. Need to change the IP address globally? Just change the variable and "recompile."
- Super extensible! Plug-in architecture makes adding new DNS providers and Registrars easy!
- Reduce point of failure: Easily maintain dual DNS providers and easily drop one that is down.
- Apply CI/CD principles to DNS: Unit-tests, system-tests, automated deployment.
- Optimize DNS with SPF optimizer. Detect too many lookups. Flatten includes.
- Enable/disable Cloudflare proxying (the "orange cloud" button) directly from your DNSControl files.
- Keep similar domains in sync with transforms, macros, and variables.

    <releaseNotes>[Package Changelog](https://github.com/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/automatic/dnscontrol/Changelog.md)

## Software ChangelogAnother big release!  Two new providers (Linode, OVH), Gandi now supports registration functions, and my favorite new feature: the SPF optimizer!

New features:

* SPF Optimizer!  dnscontrol's compiler now has an optimizer. Our first optimization is to improve your SPF records.  See https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/spf-optimizer for info. Thanks to @captncraig for contributing this.

The language has changed slightly:

* Defining a domain twice is now considered an error.
* Labels that are FQDNs is now an error. (this is a common typo)
* Downcase DNS names (#253).  DNSControl is opinionated and we've added a new optinion: All DNS labels and targets should be lowercase.  Uppercase (language permitting) is now downcased silently.

Provider-specific improvements:

* New provider: Linode  (#268)
* New Provider: OVH DNS Provider (#143) (#175)
* GANDI: Registrar support (#274)
* NAMECHEAP: Rate limiting now only throttles when needed
* NS1: Add SRV record support (#277)
* NS1: TXT records are broken if they contain spaces (#270)
* ROUTE53: Update aws libraries and remove "waiter" code.

Plus many code cleanups and fixes:

* Upgrade to newest miekg/dns library
* Rename source files that don't match the name/nameProvider.go standard. (#261)
* Improved Namecheap documentation (#221) (#232)
* Improved documentation: Document that creds.json can include env variables, improve Namecheap docs, improve explanation of how to write a new provider, release engineering docs, and a massive overhaul to the website docs by Patrick G

Thanks to everyone for their contributions!</releaseNotes>
