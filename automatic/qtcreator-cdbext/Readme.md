Qt Creator CDB Extension adds support for the Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) to Qt Creator, a cross-platform, complete integrated development environment (IDE) for application developers to create applications for multiple desktop and mobile device platforms, such as Android and iOS.

The Debugging Tools for Windows (which include the CDB debugger) need to be installed separately by installing one of the components mentioned on [this Microsoft help page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/). (Chocolatey packages for different versions of the components are available.)
