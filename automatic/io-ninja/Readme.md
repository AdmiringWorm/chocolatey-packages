IO Ninja is a professional all-in-one terminal emulator, sniffer, and protocol analyzer. IO Ninja is highly modular and has plugins for most transports and protocols you might сome across — network (TCP, UDP, SSL, SSH, WebSockets, etc.), serial (UART, I2C, SPI, Modbus, etc.), and others (USB, Pipes, J-Link RTT, etc.). IO Ninja is scriptable and allows you to generate packets programmatically, react to incoming packets and other IO events, and create non-standard protocol analyzers.

IO Ninja is your debugger for any IO-related task and a must-have tool for network security experts, system administrators, and all developers who deal with network programming in their line of work.
