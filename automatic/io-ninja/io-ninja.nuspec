    <tags>io-ninja admin ipv6 script terminal emulator monitor IO Ninja</tags>
    <summary>IO Ninja is an all-in-one IPv6-enabled scriptable/programmable terminal emulator and IO monitor.
    It is aimed at system administrators, network security experts and developers of communications software, firmware and hardware.</summary>
    <description>
## Scriptable/Programmable
The word *"programmable"* speaks for itself.
Now you can turn IO Ninja into your personal IO debugger and tune it to your liking with
[Jancy scripting](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!jancy)
Whether you need a non-standard protocol analyzer, a network device emulator or an IO
testing utility, IO Ninja can be programmed to do the job.
We also provide an [IO Ninja IDE](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!ide)
(Integrated Development Environment) to assist you in exploring and making use of scripting in IO Ninja.

## IPV6 Support
IO Ninja is now [IPv6-enabled](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!ipv6)!
All socket-based IO Ninja sessions can listen on IPv6 or IPv4 adapters and connect to IPv6 or IPv4 addresses.
So if you are looking for a terminal emulator to test IPv6-connectivity of your products, you have just found one.

## Binary Data Support
Need low-level IO terminal to send binary data over TCP?
Or send hex to serial port? Ninja would be the best tool for
[binary packets](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!packet-builder) transmission.
We not only have a modern and convenient hex-editor.
Dig this - you can actually copy-paste C-language defintions of packet structs and edit them using property grid!
Binary data transmission capabilities are matched by equally good support for displaying both incoming and outgoing
(RX/TX) binary data in a [communication log](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!advanced-logging).

## Redirect Anything-to-Anything
IO Ninja features [session linking](http://tibbo.com/ninja/features.html#!linking)
which turns it to a universal redirector.
Create two sessions (possibly, of completely different nature), configure and link them together.
All the data will be passed-through from one end to another and vice versa.
Need to access a serial device attached to your PC from another machine across the Internet?
In IO Ninja it's done with a couple of clicks.

## Free For Personal Use
Last, but not least, IO Ninja is free for non-commercial usage.
However, if you plan to use IO Ninja for work-related purposes, you have to [purchase a license](http://tibbo.com/ninja/purchase.html).
If you already have a license for IO Ninja version 2.x.x, you can upgrade it to a commercial license for IO Ninja version 3.x.x free of charge.
