        <description><![CDATA[**Protect your files effortlessly**
Encrypt 2 GB for free today.

## Features

- **Easiest encryption you'll ever use:** NordLocker offers a fast and intuitive interface. But don’t be deceived by the basic process. As soon as you drag a file into the locker, it's encrypted with the most advanced ciphers and principles
- **Supports all file types:** Create lockers — your digital safes — and protect your data from hackers. Add any file. No one can open your locker or know what's inside without your permission.
- **Keep your files anywhere you like:** After you encrypt files on your computer, you can transfer them anywhere you like. Like your favorite cloud provider. Or a removable drive. Or keep them on your computer. No matter where your files go, the locker protects them.
- **Share securely:** Need to transfer confidential data to a partner or a client? Give them access to the encrypted file and send it through email, messenger apps, upload to the cloud, or choose any other service – any way is safe when your files are secured by NordLocker.

## Notes

- This software is only supported on Windows 10 platforms. Installation will fail on earlier platforms.
- Uninstall is not entirely silent, a question wether you want to keep the application data will be prompted during installation.
