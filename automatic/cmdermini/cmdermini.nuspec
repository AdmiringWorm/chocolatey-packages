    <description><![CDATA[CmderMini (no bundled msysgit) is a software package created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul. Monokai color scheme, amazing clink and custom prompt layout.

The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, that is makes it great for USB Sticks or Dropbox. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

Combines utility of 2 distinct tools:

Console emulator = Conemu
Cmd.exe enhancements = clink

## Notes

This package uncompresses to 8 MB and does not include Unix integration via msysgit.
See [cmder](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmder) (250 MB) for enhanced console with bundled Unix utilities via msysgit.

## Additional Notes
**Note 1:** We're in the process of improving Cmder's initialization speed. In the next major release, the loading time is expected to be optimized significantly.

**Note 2:** Cmder is in the process of dropping [32-bit support](https://gitforwindows.org/32-bit.html) of x86 edition when the upstream projects (such as Git-for-Windows) do so.  In the next major releases of Cmder, the minimum Windows requirement will be bumped from **Windows 7 SP1** to **Windows 10**, as well.

📌 Did you know Cmder also works with **[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-Windows-Terminal-Integration)**? If you'd like to receive an official Cmder release with WT, please submit your [vote here](https://github.com/orgs/cmderdev/discussions/2864).
