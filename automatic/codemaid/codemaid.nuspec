<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- == PACKAGE SPECIFIC SECTION == -->
    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->
    <id>codemaid</id>
    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>An open source Visual Studio extension to cleanup and simplify code.</summary>
    <description>An open source Visual Studio extension to cleanup and simplify C#, C++, F#, VB, PHP, PowerShell, R, JSON, XAML, XML, ASP, HTML, CSS, LESS, SCSS, JavaScript and TypeScript coding.

## Features
- ![Code Cleaning](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-cleaning_thumb.png)
  **Code Cleaning**
  Cleanup random white space into a simple standard order. Add unspecified access modifiers. Utilize Visual Studio’s built-in formatting capabilities. Remove and sort using statements. And do it all automatically on save or on demand, from an individual file to the entire solution.
- ![CodeMaid Digging](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-digging_thumb.png)
  **Code Digging**
  Visualize and navigate through the contents of your C# and C++ files from a tree view hierarchy. Quickly switch between different sorting methods to get a better overview. Drag and drop to reorganize the code. See McCabe complexity scores and informative tooltips.
- ![CodeMaid Reorganizing](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-reorganizing_thumb.png)
  **Code Reorganizing**
  Reorganize the layout of members in a C# file to follow Microsoft’s StyleCop convention, or your own preferences. Automatically generate regions to match. Run on demand or automatically during cleanup.
- ![CodeMaid Formatting](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-formatting_thumb.png)
  **Comment Formatting**
  Format comments to wrap at a specified column and arrange tags on separate lines. Run on demand or automatically during cleanup.
- ![CodeMaid Joining](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-joining_thumb.png)
  **Joining**
  Join two adjacent lines, or a highlighted section of code onto a single line.
- ![CodeMaid Finding](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-finding_thumb.png)
  **Finding**
  Find the current file in the solution explorer window.
- ![CodeMaid Sorting](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-sorting_thumb.png)
  **Sorting**
  Sort a highlighted section of code alphabetically.
- ![CodeMaid Collapsing](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-collapsing_thumb.png)
  **Collapsing**
  Recursively collapse nodes or the entire tree in the solution explorer window.
- ![CodeMaid Progressing](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-progressing_thumb.png)
  **Progressing**
  View the overall progress of a build within Visual Studio, or in the Windows taskbar, both with a green/red status indication.
- ![CodeMaid Configuring](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-configuring_thumb.png)
  **Configuring**
  Enable, modify or disable many of the aspects of how CodeMaid does its work.
- ![CodeMaid Switching](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-switching_thumb.png)
  **Switching**
  Switch between related files, such as cpp and header files or xaml and code-behind.
- ![CodeMaid Toggling](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-toggling_thumb.png)
  **Toggling**
  Toggle read-only state of files without jumping into the windows explorer.
- ![CodeMaid and more](http://www.codemaid.net/wp-content/themes/codemaid/images/code-andmore_thumb.png)
  **and More!**
  Remove regions, close read-only files, etc.</description>
