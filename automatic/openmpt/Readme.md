**OpenMPT** is a popular [tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_%28music_software%29) software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for **Open ModPlug Tracker**) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as [VST][vst] plugins and [ASIO][asio] output. In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files

## Notes

- Starting at version 1.30.2/1.30.02 both 32bit and 64bit editions are available in the same installer.
  Unfortunately, at the moment this means you can not decide anymore to only install 64bit or 32bit.
