OpenMPT is being developed since 1997 (initially named ModPlug Tracker) and has grown a lot since then. It can be used as a "classic" sample-based tracker to edit and play your favourite tracked music, but also as a modern DAW with plugin support and other great features. Here, you can find some of the key features of the tracker.
