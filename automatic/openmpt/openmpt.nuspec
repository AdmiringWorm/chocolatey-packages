    <description>OpenMPT is being developed since 1997 (initially named ModPlug Tracker) and has grown a lot since then. It can be used as a "classic" sample-based tracker to edit and play your favourite tracked music, but also as a modern DAW with plugin support and other great features. Here, you can find some of the key features of the tracker.</description>
    <releaseNotes>v1.27.05.00 (11 February 2018, revision 9643)
	---------------------------------------------
	Pattern tab
	   [Imp] &lt;js&gt; Seeking with sample sync now supports fine volume slides.
	   [Mod] &lt;js&gt; Interpolating the note column no longer overwrites existing instrument numbers.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Possible crash when trying to enter notes after deleting all patterns.

	Pattern tab::Find/Replace
	   [Imp] &lt;js&gt; If no pattern selection is made, pre-fill the Find fields with values from the current pattern cell if they have not been used in a previous search (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1082).
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; After an unsuccessful search, show the correct search strings when searching for PC events.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; When repeating a search for PC events, the previous parameter value was not filled in correctly.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Searching for specific plugin parameter values did not work correctly.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Searching for PC events sometimes found normal events and vice versa.

	Sample tab
	   [Imp] &lt;js&gt; Add drop-down menu for saving all samples.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Upsampling a sample selection did not scale the new selection correctly if its end exceeded the old sample length (tx Xemogasa).

	Instrument tab
	   [Imp] &lt;js&gt; Add drop-down menu for saving all instruments.

	Comments tab
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Soft tabs did not have the correct size most of the time (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1083).

	Tree view
	   [Mod] &lt;js&gt; Do not enforce dragged-over items to be completely visible when using drag and drop (tx sincx).
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Duplicating or inserting instruments or samples did not refresh the pattern view properly.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Even after removing all patterns, they were still visible.

	Other formats
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; MED: Correctly import patterns with less channels than the maximum used amount.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; STM: More accurate tempo calculation and better support for old format versions.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Possible small memory leaks and crashes with malformed STP files.

	Misc
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; Loading the default keyboard configuration didn't load all default keys since OpenMPT 1.27.01.00, causing issues such as making instrument number entry with the regular number keys impossible.
	   [Fix] &lt;js&gt; More accurate song length calculation for pattern loops that have no start command (SB0).</releaseNotes>
