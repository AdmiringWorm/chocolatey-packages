    <tags>xvid admin codec  compression video recording</tags>
    <summary>The free video codec that's strong in compression and quality. Number one choice of millions worldwide.</summary>
    <description>
## Highest Performance
Xvid runs very fast as it is optimized for the latest CPUs.
Recording videos from a camera in realtime or playing back HD video smoothly are not a problem.
Your computer will still have plenty of power left for your other tasks!

## Plays Everywhere
A big advantage of Xvid compressed video files is that they play almost anywhere.
The Xvid software runs on many platforms and most popular video players support it.
Also, home entertainment devices like TVs or DVD/BD playsers can handle Xvid video.

## Strong Compression
The Xvid codec compresses video to make them smaller.
It can compress video at a ratio of 200:1 or more compared to uncompressed video.
This makes transmitting the video over a network speedy or saves a lot of space on your computer's hard disk.

## Great Picture Quality
While Xvid compresses video very well, it can do so without causing visible quality loss and by retaining
a sharper picture than other codecs do.
Xvid is *"lossy"* compression but aims at removing just those picture details that are not important for human
perception.
As such, it be seen as a MP3 for video.
