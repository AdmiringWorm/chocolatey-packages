<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <tags>xvid admin codec  compression video recording</tags>
    <summary>The free video codec that's strong in compression and quality. Number one choice of millions worldwide.</summary>
    <description>
## Highest Performance
Xvid runs very fast as it is optimized for the latest CPUs.
Recording videos from a camera in realtime or playing back HD video smoothly are not a problem.
Your computer will still have plenty of power left for your other tasks!

## Plays Everywhere
A big advantage of Xvid compressed video files is that they play almost anywhere.
The Xvid software runs on many platforms and most popular video players support it.
Also, home entertainment devices like TVs or DVD/BD playsers can handle Xvid video.

## Strong Compression
The Xvid codec compresses video to make them smaller.
It can compress video at a ratio of 200:1 or more compared to uncompressed video.
This makes transmitting the video over a network speedy or saves a lot of space on your computer's hard disk.

## Great Picture Quality
While Xvid compresses video very well, it can do so without causing visible quality loss and by retaining
a sharper picture than other codecs do.
Xvid is *"lossy"* compression but aims at removing just those picture details that are not important for human
perception.
As such, it be seen as a MP3 for video.
