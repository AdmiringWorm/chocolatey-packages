    <description><![CDATA[Uplay is a service created by Ubisoft that provides its users with an experience similar to the achievements offered by other game companies. The service is provided across various platforms including: PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox360, Facebook, iPhone, iPad, and most recently revealed, OnLive.

Each Uplay enabled game has various actions that can be accomplished to earn Uplay points. You can then spend these points to unlock game-related rewards for any available game. On Uplay you can find the hottest games from Ubisoft along with all the information you need on them.

The application displays a user-friendly interface which makes it easy to use by anyone. From a main window you are able to browse game releases, add new ones to your library and even launch those which you have installed.

You can also manage your account information and see what games your friends are playing. To make things easier, Uplay even displays the awards you can win and also provides information about what you have to achieve for each one.
