Wave Engine is a C# component-based modern game engine which allows you to create cross-platform games and apps for many platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS, IOS, Android, Windows Store and Windows Phone.

Wave Engine supports the same set of features in all its platforms to make it easy to port all your projects to other supported platforms.

You also have a great set of extensions with the complete code on Github, to use WaveEngine with Kinect, OculusRift, Vuforia, Cardboard, Leapmotion and much more.
