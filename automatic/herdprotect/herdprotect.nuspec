## What is herdProtect?
herdProtect is a second line of defense malware scanning platform powered by [68 anti-malware engines](https://www.herdprotect.com/engines.aspx) in
the cloud.
Since no single anti-malware program is perfect 100% of the time, herdProtect utilizes a *'herd'* of multiple engines to
guarantee the widest coverage and the earliest possible detection.
As a second line of defense anti-malware solution, herdProtect is designed to run with any existing anti-virus program
already installed on a user's PC.
herdProtect is a free service to help user's find and remove malicious software.

## How does it work?
The herdProtect scanning engine works by monitoring the active objects (processes, modules, drivers, etc.) on a user's PC
as well as the hundreds of auto-start execution points (ASEPs).
As new objects such as processes become active in the system, herdProtect will use a secured network tunnel to scan the
object for malware against the engines of the top 68 anti-malware scanners.
By scanning in the cloud all processor intensive activites are performed independent of the user's PC.
Depending on the aggregate results of the scan,
the user can then take the appropriate actions and keep their PC free from any known malware threats.

## Why do I need it?
One anti-virus product is just not enough these days.
The top 10 anti-virus engines only detect around 90% ([see knowledgeBase](https://www.herdprotect.com/knowledgebase.aspx)) of known and zero-day
threats which leaves your PC open to numerous viruses, trojans, rootkits, dialers
and spyware that many anti-virus programs might not detect.
The problem is that running more than one anti-virus platform on your PC is usually detrimental to your PC's overall
performance due to the fact that these products might fight for resources essentially deadlocking your PC.
With over 100,000 new threats discovered daily, it would be impossible for any single prodct to provide guaranteed
protection 100% of the time.
However, herdProtect is different, it uses the collective wisdom of the top 68 anti-malware scanners
(known as multi-scanning) to make sure that a known threat does not go undetected.
When new threats emerge, only one of those engines needs to detect the malware for your system to be protected.
In addition, because its scanning is performed in the cloud, your PC's performance is not effected and herdProtect is
designed to co-exist with any existing anti-malware platform already running on your PC.
