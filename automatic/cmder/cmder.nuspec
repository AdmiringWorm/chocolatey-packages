    <summary>Lovely console emulator package for Windows</summary>
    <!-- Do not touch the description here in the nuspec file. Description is imported during update from the Readme.md file -->
    <description><![CDATA[Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul. Monokai color scheme, amazing clink and custom prompt layout.

The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, that is makes it great for USB Sticks or Dropbox. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

Combines utility of 3 distinct tools:

- Console emulator = Conemu
- Cmd.exe enhancements = clink
- Unix tools on windows = msysgit

## Notes

This package uncompresses to 250 MB and includes Unix commands via bundled msysgit.
See [cmdermini](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmdermini) (8 MB) for basic console without bundled msysgit.
