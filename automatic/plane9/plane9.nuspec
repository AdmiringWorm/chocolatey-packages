    <description><![CDATA[Plane9 is a 3d **visualizer** where you never have to settle for just one view ever again. It features over 250 predefined [scenes][] to choose from. But it doesn't end there since the scenes can be [combined][] with one another to form a near endless supply of new views to experience. 39 transition are used to form a continous experience when moving from scene to scene.

The visualizer can be used either as standalone window, screensaver, **oculus rift** or **HTC Vive** VR visualizer. It is **sound sensitive** and reacts to what your currently listening to, be it from spotify, iTunes or any another sound source, it can even react to what you record from a microphone or other input.

If you feel stressed out over how all this content can fit in such a neat little package then you can always view the [relaxing music video][] to find your center again.

## Features
- Reacts to music that you play or get from any input
- The scene concept where one scene act as a screensaver/visualizer in itself so you get a lot of variety in a small size
- It detects when the monitor goes into standby and pauses/shuts down to save power
- Can analyze sound from up to 18 speakers
- Supports multiple monitors
- Is still actively being developed

## Notes
- After installation, the screensaver settings dialog pops up. It was decided not to forcibly close this dialog.
