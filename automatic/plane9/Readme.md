Plane9 is a 3d **visualizer** where you never have to settle for just one view ever again. It features over 250 predefined [scenes][] to choose from. But it doesn't end there since the scenes can be [combined][] with one another to form a near endless supply of new views to experience. 39 transition are used to form a continous experience when moving from scene to scene.

The visualizer can be used either as standalone window, screensaver, **oculus rift** or **HTC Vive** VR visualizer. It is **sound sensitive** and reacts to what your currently listening to, be it from spotify, iTunes or any another sound source, it can even react to what you record from a microphone or other input.

If you feel stressed out over how all this content can fit in such a neat little package then you can always view the [relaxing music video][] to find your center again.
